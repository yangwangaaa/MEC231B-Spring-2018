## Midterm 2
Robust Analysis and Extended Kalman Filter, personal answers are in the `Midterm2/allfiles/`

Parking Navigation: 
- No obstacles: `q1b.m`
- 3 steps parking with obstacles: `q1b.m`
- more steps parking with obstacles: `q1c.m`
- signed distance formulation used: `q1d.m`
- convexication for steering left and right: `q1e.m`
