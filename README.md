## Midterm 1
Basic drone dynamics questions and Kalman Filter knowledge

## Kalman Filter Homework
Basic KF and EKF understanding

## Robust Control Homework
Some Robust Control Examples

## Lab5
Kalman filter and Extended kalman filter applied to bicycle vehicle model
- Three basic scenarios simulations: `Lab5/p1`
- Nonlinear Dynamics based on Euler model: `Lab5/p2`
- Linearization for EKF: `Lab5/p3`
- KF Implementation: `Lab5/p4`
- EKF Implementation: `Lab5/p5` 

## Lab6
Path planning material, including RRT and Dynamic Optimization
- Standard RRT (no obstacles): `Lab6/q1`
- Standard RRT (with obstacles): `Lab6/q2`
- Standard RRT with Vehicle Kinetic Model (no obstacles): `Lab6/q3`
- Standard RRT with Vehicle Kinetic Model (with obstacles): `Lab6/q4`
- Navigation problem formulated as nonlinear programming (question 7) or mixed integer quadratic programming (question 8): `Lab6/q7q8`

## Midterm 2
Robust Analysis and Extended Kalman Filter, personal answers are in the `Midterm2/allfiles/`

Parking Navigation: 
- No obstacles: `q1b.m`
- 3 steps parking with obstacles: `q1b.m`
- more steps parking with obstacles: `q1c.m`
- signed distance formulation used: `q1d.m`
- convexication for steering left and right: `q1e.m`

Robust Analysis
